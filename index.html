 <p style="text-align:left; color:white; font-size:20px">     Whatap, dawgies?! My name is Maria Nicole Escalante. I enjoy telling jokes that I 
  didn't make up at all and I love bagging on people. Especially those turd-eaters named Enrique. Oh, and even more 
  points if their middle name starts like octopus and their last name is Pena. I am seventeen years old, but definitely no dancing queen. At least
  in myyy opinion I definitely know how to bust a move, but others might disagree and...I once made a person barf by performing a dance routine for them.
  Yeahh...my self-esteem was at an all time low when that happened, but isss ok. I'm all good now. My self-esteem is higher than ever.
  Bet you can tell too, huh? 'Cuz all I've been doing so far is talking about myself. But what else can I do?! I mean, even if I type in 
  the question "How are you?" you can't really answer back. Well, I suppose you could, but you'd be talking to a computer screen and 
  people will look at you all kinds of funny. Trust me, I been there. I also really like karaoke. I sound like a dying chicken, but I'll sing my heart out if given a chance.
  I'm the oldest of five, I have the cutest pet rat named Peaches, and my brain is fried. It's fried from all the work I don't do. I sleep a lot.
  And it gets so tiring that I have to sleep some more. I've never in my life been in trouble for punching a grandma, and I hope that that 
  reputation will hold up as long as I live...or at least until my siblings and I are old hags and my sister pushes my buttons one more 'gain.
  I like Rickrolling peeps, and maddogging little kids 'cuz I'm a punk like that. Try me, homie.
